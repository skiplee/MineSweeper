Minesweeper Kata

Idea from: http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataMinesweeper

Intent:
Build a (tested) model of game with methods to create an initial game, take moves, and track the current state.
Build and hook up a Winform UI.
Build and hook up a Web UI.

Basically modeled after the Windows game, but the intial square won't have to be guessed at - one good square will be exposed.
